# Oscillation Project

Welcome to the Oscillation Methods website!

This website hosts an online version of the code and figures for the "methodological considerations for studying neural oscillations" project.

## Overview

This website hosts content relating to exploring methodological considerations for analyzing neural oscillations.

In the notebooks that are hosted on this website, we use simulated data to explore the relationship between data properties and common analysis approaches. In doing so, we highlight potential issues, organized into a collection of 7 methodological considerations.

The 7 methodological considerations are:
- #1) verifying the presence of oscillations
- #2) band definitions
- #3) aperiodic activity
- #4) temporal variability
- #5) waveform shape
- #6) overlapping rhythms / source separation
- #7) power confounds / signal-to-noise ratio

These materials are created as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), and are intended to be executed and explored in a hands-on manner. There is a download link at the top left of the page, that can be used to download each page as a notebook.
