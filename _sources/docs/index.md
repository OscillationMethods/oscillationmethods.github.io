# Oscillation Project

Welcome to the Oscillation Methods project website! This website hosts an online version of the code and figures for the
["methodological considerations for studying neural oscillations"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.15361)
project, in which we review methods & concepts related to measuring & interpreting oscillatory neural activity.

## Overview

To examine these topics, we use simulated data to explore the relationship between data properties and common analysis approaches. In doing so, we highlight potential issues, organized into a collection of 7 methodological considerations.

The 7 methodological considerations are:
- #1) verifying the presence of oscillations
- #2) band definitions
- #3) aperiodic activity
- #4) temporal variability
- #5) waveform shape
- #6) overlapping rhythms / source separation
- #7) power confounds / signal-to-noise ratio

This website hosts two complementary ways to explore the topics, including an overview page stepping through the topics with animated visualizers (animated versions of the figures in the paper), and a hosted copy of the code that steps through creating each panel of the figures in the paper. In the notebooks section, materials are created as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), which can also be downloaded (from the link at the top left of the page) and executed and explored in a hands-on manner.
